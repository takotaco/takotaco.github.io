					<h3>Constraints and Inspiration</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>The cardboard bench was a project for an Industrial Design for non-majors class I took in the spring of 2013.
						</p>
						<p>
							The requirements for the project were simple: make a chair; make it entirely out of cardboard and nothing else.
						</p>
						<p>
							To the right you can see some of my inspiration. Initially I wanted to make a chair as creepy as possible: something that you would't want to sit in even if you could.

					<h3>Initial Sketches</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							Next I did some research. What did chairs look like? What forms were possible? Here you can see some of the sketches I did while examining a wall full of chairs at the Carnegie Art Museum.
						</p>
						<p>
							After researching chairs in general I did some sketches of what my chair might look like. How could I make something out of cardboard that would support a human and also look like a centipede? A bench seemed appropriate.
						</p>
						<p>
							 I did a lot more sketches that I don't have room for here.

					<h3>Prototype</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							After I came up with an idea I liked, I made a scaled-down prototype. Since it was so small I used card stock to approximate cardboard.
						</p>
						<p>
							I tested the prototype for weight capacity and ease of assembly. Since I wasn't allowed to use any material other than cardboard, I had to design the bench in such a way that it would hold together without glue, tape, or staples. I also had to make sure it wouldn't fall apart as soon as someone sat on it.

					<h3>The Final Result</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							After finding success with my prototype, I made a full scale version! I measured and cut this entirely by hand out of 2-ply cardboard. It can fit and support about three people.

					<h3>Ideas & Prototype</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>Project Flow was a project I worked on for a class called "Tech Startup Lab" in the Fall of 2012. My idea was to create a "how-to" website that used flowcharts rather than lists or photos to convey instructions. The vision was that Project Flow could be used to describe more complex processes than the average "how-to" site and thus become insanely popular.
						</p>
						<p>
							Safe to say that never happened, but you can still try out the prototype!
						</p>
						<p>
							 I lead the project and worked with two other people, one business person and one other developer. The code in this prototype is entirely my own.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main goal I had when designing the interface was to eliminate the need to select different tools from a menu to create the boxes and arrows or to move them around. I wanted to make the interface as intuitive as possible so that users could make flowcharts quickly. I also wanted to use the HTML5 canvas as it had recently been released and I thought (and still think) it's awesome.
						</p>
						<p>
							If I were to ever go back and continue working on this project, the next step would be to do user testing.

					<h3>Sketch</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>I worked on this project on and off from May through December 2014.</p>

						<p>First I made a sketch of the image I had in my mind.
						Initially I wanted to make the image as complex a possible to take advantage of the fact that a laser would be cutting it out for me.</p>
						<p>To get the bee just right I did some research on bee anatomy. 
						Using reference images I was able to make sure the image in my head came out on paper as an accurate representation of a bee.</p> 
						<p>I used Adobe Photoshop and my Wacom tablet to create this sketch.</p>

					<h3>Vector Outline</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>After I finalized the sketch I went back over the outline with a vector tool in Adobe Illustrator.
						I did this for two reasons: first, I found out that a laser will cut faster and more accurately given a vector image rather than a raster image; second, I wanted the practice.
						This step took a long time. At this point I decided to exclude the flower from the final design for time reasons.</p> 
						<p>As part of this step I also spent time colorizing the vector lines based on what I wanted the laser to do.
						Here I wanted the laser to do two depths or darknesses of engraving and one pass of cutting all the way through the material.</p>
						<p>Note that the bee also only has four legs! I chose to omit the other two because I felt that that area became too busy and hard to understand with all six legs.</p>

					<h3>The Final Result</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>As the final step I took my designs down to my local laser cutting facility and got it cut out of 3-ply plywood.
						I was quite pleased with the result!</p>
						<p>If I were to do this project again, I'd omit the engraving lines where they overlapped with the cutting lines. This made the really thin areas, like the wings, extremely fragile.</p>
