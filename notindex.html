					<h3>Constraints and Inspiration</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>The cardboard bench was a project for the "Industrial Design Fundamentals" class I took in the Spring of 2013 at Carnegie Mellon.
						</p>
						<p>
							The requirements for the project were simple: make a chair; make it entirely out of cardboard.
						</p>
						<p>
							First I gathered inspiration, some of which you can see here. I wanted to make a chair that was as creepy as possible: something that you wouldn't want to sit in even if you could.
						</p>

					<h3>Initial Sketches</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							Next I did some research. What did chairs look like? What forms were possible? To answer this I went to the Carnegie Art Museum to sketch some of the chairs in their collection.
						</p>
						<p>
							After my research, I did some sketches of what my chair might look like. How could I make something out of cardboard that would support a human and also look like a centipede?

					<h3>Prototype</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							After I came up with an idea that I liked, I made a scaled-down prototype. Since it was so small, I used card stock to approximate cardboard.
						</p>
						<p>
							I tested the prototype for weight capacity and ease of assembly. Since I wasn't allowed to use any material other than cardboard, I had to design the bench in such a way that it could be put together without glue, tape, or staples. I also had to make sure it wouldn't fall apart as soon as someone sat on it.

					<h3>The Final Result</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							After finding success with my prototype, I made a full scale version! I measured and cut this entirely by hand out of 2-ply cardboard.
						</p>
						<p>It can fit and support about three people.

					<h3>Ideas & Prototype</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>Project Flow was a project I worked on for a class called "Tech Startup Lab" in the Fall of 2012 at Carnegie Mellon. To get into the class students had to form a team and pitch an idea for a startup to the professor. My idea was to create a "how-to" website that used flowcharts rather than lists or photos to convey instructions.
						</p>
						<p>
							 I lead the project and worked with two other people: one business person and one other developer. The code in this prototype is entirely my own.
						</p>
						<p>
						When designing the interface I wanted to eliminate the need to select different tools from a menu to create and move the boxes and arrows. I wanted to make the interface as intuitive as possible so that users could make flowcharts quickly. I also wanted to use the HTML5 canvas as it had recently been released and I thought &mdash; and still think &mdash; that it's awesome.

					<h3>Sketch</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>This was a personal project that I worked on from May through December 2014.</p>

						<p>First I drew a sketch of the image I had in my mind.
						I made the image very complex to take advantage of the fact that a laser would be cutting it out for me.</p>

					<h3>Vector Outline</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>After I finalized the sketch I made a vector drawing. I did this to take advantage of the fact that a laser will cut faster and more accurately given a vector image rather than a raster image.
						</p>
						<p>I colorized the lines to indicate what the laser should do: I wanted some parts of the material to be engraved at different depths and some parts to be cut all the way through.

					<h3>The Final Result</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>As the final step I took my designs down to my local laser cutting facility and got it cut out of plywood.
						I was quite pleased with the result!</p>
